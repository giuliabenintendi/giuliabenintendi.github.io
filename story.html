      I'm a girl who dreamed of being prime minister when she was 8 (yes, prime minister 😄).
      You may wonder why I'm even mentioning that, but actually this says quite a lot about me.
      But, back to facts. What's still left from there? I have never stopped believing in myself.
      I've always seen in me the best investment I could make. You might think I overestimate myself,
      but that's not the whole story. I've never felt tremendously talented but I have always been
      100% sure that hard work is what makes the difference (and years of running competitions
      confirmed that 😊).

      I believe we live in a world where working hard isn't an obligation. It's a choice you make
      when you've found something you truly believe in.

      I was 17 and I was wondering where to put my highest bet: my future. This is how I ended up
      in automation engineering in the first place. I just wanted to be where the future was heading.
      I felt like we were all living in an amusement park but without being able to jump on a roller
      coaster. And I wanted to ride it. I won't lie: I didn't know what to expect. I barely knew
      what I was getting into. I just felt it was the right thing to do.

      Nowadays I see that things are moving fast and now more than ever I feel like the future is
      in too few hands right now, and we shouldn't just keep up with what's happening around us.
      We should be able to contribute, to show our value, to show that we matter. You might wonder
      how, or whether I know the secret. I don't. But I believe we should care about what is going
      on around us and believe in ourselves. Dedicate our time to learning, working, building.
      Not to make money, but to stay alive in the truest sense.

      I don't want to stand still and wait for things to happen. I won't become the next prime
      minister but at least I don't want to live in a society where I can't make my contribution.
      This is what I do, this is who I am, and this is why I'll never stop investing in myself.
